### Contributing

We welcome suggestions to this reading list.

In the [issues](https://github.com/mmcgrana/services-engineering/issues)
for this repository we track both specific suggestions for additions
as well as topics that we'd like to cover don't have good resources
for yet. Please make your own suggestions by opening an issue or
commenting on an existing one. We've already incorporated many good
suggestions from early readers of this list!

Note that the list only includes material that's been read
personally by the editor, so some suggestions may have a long
turnaround time, especially books.
